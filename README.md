# Primes Multiplication Table

A program which takes a number, identifies all primes below it and one above, and displays a multiplication table.

## Installing the program

1. Download the program from GitHub

2. Open the root folder (FindMyPast) in your console

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```npm install```

4. For testing, install mocha:

    ```npm install --save-dev mocha```

5. You will need prompt-sync as well:

    ```npm install prompt-sync```

You are now ready to run the code:

    ```node main/prime.js```

Once you run the code, please ignore the index cells,
only the main body cells hold the relevant information.

Or for tests:

    npm test

Once the program runs, please input number as 0 to avoid interfering with expected results.

## What I'm pleased with

Learning to use console.table.
Being able to manipulate the data to have it display correctly in the table.

## If I had more time

Manipulate the data more so the prime numbers were stored as the index row and column.

Connect to front-end and display it in a browser.
